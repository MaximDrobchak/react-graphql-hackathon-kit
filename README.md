# react-graphql-hackathon-kit

Get a simple app with React and GraphQL up and running in seconds!

> Developed for the [Reactathon](https://www.reactathon.com/) [Hackathon](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/reactjs-hackathon-github-tickets-31439578626) on March 11-12, 2017.

This project has two parts:

1. [/server](server) is a simple GraphQL server built with Node, Babel, GraphQL.js, and graphql-tools
1. [/client](client) is an app built with Create React App, React Router, and Apollo Client

### Running the app

To run the app, follow the directions for starting the client and server, in separate terminal windows. The server runs on port `8080`, and the client is hard-coded to talk to that port.

```
# Terminal 1
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

```
# Terminal 2
cd client
npm install
npm start
```
