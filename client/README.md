# Apollo React Hackathon Starter Kit

This demonstrates simple parameterized queries and routing. Get the full details about using Apollo with React in [the official Apollo docs](http://dev.apollodata.com/react/).

## Starting the app

This app talks to the GraphQL server found at [/server](../server).

Once you've installed and started that server, start this app with:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

It will open a browser window, or you can browse to http://localhost:3000.
